# [Race Against The Machine](https://bangoo040993.github.io/unit-1-project/)
#### This is a game inspired by "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock", but with a different theme. Instead of the traditional options, the player can choose one of five factions: "Marine", "Covenant", "Flood", "Forerunner", or "Precursor". The game has a backstory where an AI named Cortana has been corrupted over time. Instead of assisting humans in their battles against other races, it has turned against them and often chooses to side with the opposing factions, including sometimes turning against its own kind. The player's objective is to defeat Cortana by choosing the faction that can overcome its choice. The game uses a comparison function to determine the winner of each round, and the result is displayed on the web page. The player can make their choice by clicking on the corresponding button (represented by picture and name), and the game logic is triggered by an event listener. The computer's choice is generated randomly at the beginning of each round.

### Techonologies used: Javascript, Html, CSS, Remove.bg

##### Future enchancement:
- I was in a time crunch but i want to make the button transform translate to scale down accordingly to the display sizes and also along side with the image background. 
- I also want to add a counter for for win losses and ties
- add a display result that pull and image or gif of the associate race fighting each other
- i kind of cheated by drawing the result of line pentagon i want to see if i could do it with just css alone? which should help with the scaling when using a different display
- also add a logic or function that make sure the player dont win more than 5 times in a role. 
- add an option to let two player to play
- add more races but if i do itll probably make more sense if i do pokemon
